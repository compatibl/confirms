1. There's a green apple in a box. This is the original green apple.

2. In the same box, there are three red apples.

3. Each of these three red apples is in the same box as two green apples. 

This means:
For the 1st red apple: there are 2 green apples.
For the 2nd red apple: there are 2 green apples.
For the 3rd red apple: there are 2 green apples.

Total additional green apples due to the 3 red apples: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 green apples.

But we have to remember that we've already counted the original green apple, so when counting the total number of green apples associated with each red apple, we need to be cautious about double counting.

Let's check if we've double-counted:

The 1st red apple has 2 green apples in the box with it. One of those green apples is the original green apple. So, it introduces 1 new green apple.

The 2nd red apple also has 2 green apples in the box with it. Again, one of those is the original green apple. It also introduces another new green apple.

The 3rd red apple, just like the previous two, has the original green apple and another new green apple.

Now, summing it all up, including the original green apple:
Original green apple + the 6 green apples from the red apples' association = 1 + 6 = 7 green apples in total.

However, the question specifically asks for how many ""other"" green apples are in the same box as the original green apple, so excluding the original green apple from our count:

- Red Apple 1 has 2 green apples
- Red Apple 2 has 2 green apples
- Red Apple 3 has 2 green apples

2 green apples x 3 red apples = 6 green apples.

However, we have to be careful not to count the original green apple multiple times. Since all the apples are in the same box, when the context says that each red apple is in the box with two green apples, the original green apple is counted in those pairs for each red apple.

1. A green apple is in the same box as three red apples. 
So far, there is 1 green apple and 3 red apples in the box.

2. Each of these three red apples is in the same box as two green apples.
For every red apple, there are 2 green apples in the box. So for the 3 red apples, there are:
3 red apples × 2 green apples/red apple = 6 green apples.

Now, adding the original green apple to the 6 green apples from the above calculation:
1 green apple + 6 green apples = 7 green apples in total.

However, since we want to know how many other green apples are in the box with the original green apple:
7 green apples - 1 original green apple = 6 other green apples.

So, according to the information provided, there are 6 other green apples in the same box as the original green apple.",There are six other green apples in the same box as the original green apple.,"  To answer your question, we need to follow the information given in the context:

For the three red apples:

- The first red apple is in the box with 2 green apples.
- The second red apple is in the box with 2 green apples.
- The third red apple is in the box with 2 green apples.

This gives a total of 3 red apples × 2 green apples/red apple = 6 green apples.

However, it's important to note that the original green apple mentioned at the beginning is one of the green apples associated with each of the three red apples. Therefore, it's being counted three times. So, we need to subtract the count of this original green apple from our total:

6 green apples - 3 (counting the original green apple three times) = 3 green apples.

This means:
- The 1st red apple has 2 green apples.
- The 2nd red apple has 2 green apples.
- The 3rd red apple has 2 green apples.

In total, this is 3 red apples × 2 green apples/red apple = 6 green apples.

However, we need to account for the overlap in counting the green apples since the same green apples could be counted multiple times.

Given the information, we can infer that there is only one box, and the green apples are shared among the red apples. The first green apple mentioned is included in the count of the two green apples for each red apple. So, for clarity:
